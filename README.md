# ğŸ’» Added functionalities ğŸ’» :
(basic hyprland functionalities are still here but wont be included here)
* turn volume up and down with the ğŸ”Š and ğŸ”‰ keys
* increase/decrease brightness with the brightness keys
* power button
* application launcher

# ğŸ¤– Installer ğŸ¤– :
I might create an installer in the future to quickly put config files where they are needed.
